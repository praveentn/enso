Algebra used to be narrated in words, sometimes in sentences, or even paragraphs of text. It was not until the 1600's that algebra was expressed in symbols and equations, which was a significant leap of progress!

Human language can also undergo a similar transformation. What it would look like then? A language which is spoken in the 'language' of mathematics perhaps. A language without disambiguations could be one achievement if it were to happen.

Imagine a language with only two words, Yes & No. Would it be possible to communicate complex emotions? Yes, of course! It is mainly because of the fact that we humans don't communicate with words alone, rather our body speaks a language, of facial expressions, variations in tone etc. Basically, we can communicate without words.

Points

- you're at the centre
- all the emotions circle you
- when a particular emotion is triggered
- it's time noted & assigned a weight
- these weights decrease over time
- until the emotions are invoked again
- at any point of time - you're the sum of your emotions
