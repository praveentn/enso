Algebra was narrated in words, sometimes in sentences, or even paragraphs of text. It was not until the 1600's that algebra was expressed in symbols and equations, which was a significant leap of progress!

Human language can also undego a similar transformation. What it would look like then? A language which is spoken in the 'language' of mathematics perhaps. A language without disambiguations could be one achievement if it were to happen.

Imagine a language with only two words, Yes & No. Would it be possible to communicate complex emotions? Yes, of course! It is mainly because of the fact that we humans don't communicate with words alone, rather our body speaks a language, of facial expressions, variations in tone etc. Basically, we can communicate without words.
